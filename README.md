This code can be used to generate simulations similar to Figs. 1, 2 and 3 in the following paper:

M. Kayaalp, V. Bordignon, S. Vlaski and A. H. Sayed, "Hidden Markov Modeling Over Graphs," 2022 IEEE Data Science and Learning Workshop (DSLW), 2022, pp. 1-6. [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.1109/DSLW53931.2022.9820077.svg)](https://doi.org/10.1109/DSLW53931.2022.9820077)

Figs. 1, 2 and 3 are generated executing file 'main.py'.

Please note that the code is not generally perfected for performance, but is rather meant to illustrate certain results from the paper. The code is provided as-is without guarantees.
